      Last February, you came into my life and we started talking. I never knew that would be the beginning of our story.
      From you wishing me happy birthday to talking every single day, each moment became a memory I'll always cherish.
      We foughtâ€”many times. But somehow, we always found our way back to each other.
      Even after we broke up once, we managed to reconnect, and this time, we both promised to give it our all.
      I know I did. You told me you'd choose me at the end of the day, and that made me feel so excited for our future. But then... we fought again.
      And now, we're on separate paths once more. Love isn't something you throw away when it gets hard. That's why I tried so hard to hold on.
      Even though I know we won't meet again, I miss youâ€”so much. I don't know how I'm going to live each day without you.
      Maybe you'll be able to move on... but I can't. I don't know how long it'll take to heal.
      Last night, I wished everything was just a dream. I wanted us to fall asleep on call, like we always used to.
      But this morning, when our call ended, I felt it in my heartâ€”it was really the end.
      I hesitated to say goodbye. I even thought about ending everything just so I could die with the memory of you by my side... but I stopped.
      Because I knew how much that would hurt you. I always believed in miracles. I still do. I just hope I can find my way back to you someday.
      Thank you, Christy. Thank you, my greatest gift. ðŸ’”
